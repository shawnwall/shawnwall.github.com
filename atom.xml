    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I run a small mobile services agency and we use (new) <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> from <a href="http://37signals">37signals</a> as our main project management &amp; collaboration tool for internal and external projects. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the new product after working through a few issues out of the gate where they removed some features from the original version. Recently I ran out of projects but my visible projects were still less than the total. The only advice I got was to upgrade my plan.</p>

<p>After digging around I find out one of my clients created a project. <strong>All invited users can create projects by default.</strong> That&#8217;s a pretty bizarre default, so watch out for it. Next I had to email support to ask them what in the world is going on and why I can&#8217;t access this project in the account that I pay for.</p>

<h2>Account owners don&#8217;t own the account</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m told there is no way to do this and that I have to ask my own client to add me to the project. Great, there&#8217;s a nice way to have me look like I&#8217;m using mediocre tools to run a core part of my business. I asked the client to add me but they either ignored, were confused, or forgot about it. Now I need to ask them again to do so. This is pretty much permissions 101: <strong>let the account owner own the account</strong>.</p>

<p>37signals, <em>just throw some links to the projects on the active projects list and let account owners be the superuser they are</em>.</p>

<p><em>After</em> Tim Cook helped streamline Apple&#8217;s operations, Microsoft and Google attempt to take on Apple head to head. The only real factors will continue to be the same - price for Google and enterprise support for Microsoft. The hardware manufacturers will continue their mediocrity while popping out more clones of the Surface &amp; Nexus 7 in addition to the iPad.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-03T15:56:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnwall.github.com/blog/2012/07/03/reality->-augmented-reality</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you used the latest AR app more than once? After reading yesterday about IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1841831/ibm-ushering-in-an-age-of-augmented-reality-shopping?partner=rss">Augmented Reality Shopping App</a> I&#8217;m starting to get fed up with this trend that attempts to solve a problem that I personally don&#8217;t view as an actual problem in the first place. What exactly <em>is</em> the problem trying to be solved? The simplest case is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Where is X?</p></blockquote>

<p>A secondary case is:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am near X, how can this experience be improved?</p></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, nearly every &#8220;solution&#8221; to this problem essentially boils down to advertising wrapped in an utterly painful user experience. First, I have to find one (or more than one) of several apps to &#8220;improve&#8221; this experience. Next, in a public space I must sever myself from human interaction and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve phone from pocket or purse</li>
<li>Open the application</li>
<li>Possibly navigate through a few screens</li>
<li>Hold the phone in front of me and attempt to derive some form of value while also potentially walking into a building and/or bus</li>
</ol>


<p>In contrast, leaving augmented reality to enter back into reality we could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Converse with nearby human beings</li>
<li>Think for ourselves and choose what is best</li>
<li>Use the built-in map features on our phones</li>
</ul>


<p>A vast majority of augmented reality implementations are simply a method to shove more advertising down our throats as if we weren&#8217;t already inundated. These wonderful computers in our pockets are getting wasted if they are simply dumbed down to another medium for advertisers.</p>
