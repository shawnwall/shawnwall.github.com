Really, how many times did you read about it up for sale prior to them actually finding a buyer?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you used the latest AR app more than once? After reading yesterday about IBM&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1841831/ibm-ushering-in-an-age-of-augmented-reality-shopping?partner=rss">Augmented Reality Shopping App</a> I&#8217;m starting to get fed up with this trend that attempts to solve a problem that I personally don&#8217;t view as an actual problem in the first place. What exactly <em>is</em> the problem trying to be solved? The simplest case is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Where is X?</p></blockquote>

<p>A secondary case is:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am near X, how can this experience be improved?</p></blockquote>

<p>Sadly, nearly every &#8220;solution&#8221; to this problem essentially boils down to advertising wrapped in an utterly painful user experience. First, I have to find one (or more than one) of several apps to &#8220;improve&#8221; this experience. Next, in a public space I must sever myself from human interaction and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrieve phone from pocket or purse</li>
<li>Open the application</li>
<li>Possibly navigate through a few screens</li>
<li>Hold the phone in front of me and attempt to derive some form of value while also potentially walking into a building and/or bus</li>
</ol>


<p>In contrast, leaving augmented reality to enter back into reality we could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Converse with nearby human beings</li>
<li>Think for ourselves and choose what is best</li>
<li>Use the built-in map features on our phones</li>
</ul>


<p>A vast majority of augmented reality implementations are simply a method to shove more advertising down our throats as if we weren&#8217;t already inundated. These wonderful computers in our pockets are getting wasted if they are simply dumbed down to another medium for advertisers.</p>
