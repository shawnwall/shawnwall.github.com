[Core Data with AFNetworking, Done Right](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFIncrementalStore)

The one and only [@mattt](http://twitter.com/mattt) brings us a clean & simple Core Data backend for RESTful services. 
My least favorite part of using [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/) was the fact that I was no longer using [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
in it, so I can't wait to see how this progresses (or actually contribute to it).
