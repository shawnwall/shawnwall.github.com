I run a small mobile services agency and we use (new) [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) from [37signals](http://37signals) as our main project management & collaboration tool for internal and external projects. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the new product after working through a few issues out of the gate where they removed some features from the original version. Recently I ran out of projects but my visible projects were still less than the total. The only advice I got was to upgrade my plan.

After digging around I find out one of my clients created a project. **All invited users can create projects by default.** That's a pretty bizarre default, so watch out for it. Next I had to email support to ask them what in the world is going on and why I can't access this project in the account that I pay for. 

## Account owners don't own the account

I'm told there is no way to do this and that I have to ask my own client to add me to the project. Great, there's a nice way to have me look like I'm using mediocre tools to run a core part of my business. I asked the client to add me but they either ignored, were confused, or forgot about it. Now I need to ask them again to do so. This is pretty much permissions 101: **let the account owner own the account**.

37signals, _just throw some links to the projects on the active projects list and let account owners be the superuser they are_.
