Here's the real reason behind [37signals](http://37signals.com/)' sale of Sortfolio. It was a stagnant product with declining revenues but they were smart enough to get massive [PR](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201207/jason-fried/when-to-kill-a-product.html) about the sale itself before the product faded into our memories. Really, how many times did you read about it up for sale prior to them actually finding a buyer?
