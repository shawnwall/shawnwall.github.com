> If Google and Microsoft canâ€™t make a must-have product around their own software, consumers may be harder to convince that hardware manufacturers could do it

_After_ Tim Cook helped streamline Apple's operations, Microsoft and Google attempt to take on Apple head to head. The only real factors will continue to be the same - price for Google and enterprise support for Microsoft. The hardware manufacturers will continue their mediocrity while popping out more clones of the Surface & Nexus 7 in addition to the iPad.
