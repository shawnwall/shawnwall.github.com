When was the last time you used the latest AR app more than once? After reading yesterday about IBM's [Augmented Reality Shopping App](http://www.fastcompany.com/1841831/ibm-ushering-in-an-age-of-augmented-reality-shopping?partner=rss) I'm starting to get fed up with this trend that attempts to solve a problem that I personally don't view as an actual problem in the first place. What exactly _is_ the problem trying to be solved? The simplest case is:

> Where is X?

A secondary case is:

> I am near X, how can this experience be improved?

Sadly, nearly every "solution" to this problem essentially boils down to advertising wrapped in an utterly painful user experience. First, I have to find one (or more than one) of several apps to "improve" this experience. Next, in a public space I must sever myself from human interaction and:

1. Retrieve phone from pocket or purse
2. Open the application
3. Possibly navigate through a few screens
4. Hold the phone in front of me and attempt to derive some form of value while also potentially walking into a building and/or bus

In contrast, leaving augmented reality to enter back into reality we could:

* Converse with nearby human beings
* Think for ourselves and choose what is best
* Use the built-in map features on our phones

A vast majority of augmented reality implementations are simply a method to shove more advertising down our throats as if we weren't already inundated. These wonderful computers in our pockets are getting wasted if they are simply dumbed down to another medium for advertisers.
